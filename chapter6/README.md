# Chapter 6 - The eBPF Verifier

Use `make` to build the example code. Make edits as suggested in the book to
cause a variety of verification errors when you attempt to load the program into
the kernel.

Problems with the `make`? Make sure you have followed the instructions to [build and install libbpf](https://github.com/lizrice/learning-ebpf/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#building-libbpf-and-installing-header-files).
