# Chapter 5 - CO-RE, BTF and libbpf

Run `make` to build the examples in this file. In the book you'll explore the
BTF data associated with the example code, as well as comparing the libbpf
approach to earlier BCC examples.


Problems with the `make`? Make sure you have followed the instructions to [build and install libbpf](https://github.com/lizrice/learning-ebpf/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#building-libbpf-and-installing-header-files).
